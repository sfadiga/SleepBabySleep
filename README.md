# SleepBabySleep

An app (desktop/mobile) made in QML for help parents put their babies to sleep.

The app has an selection of sounds (still in progress) available to be played to help the baby relax.

The application is now feature complete (at least I think so :). But it lacks the wav sound files to be in the final version.

* This version states my total lack of taste for colors :P

This is GPL license since I'm planning to deploy the App on Play store (Android version).

But feel free to use as code snippets or as an example for personal study.

This is my second 'real' QML/Quick application, so feel free to give me some advice, tips and hints. 

Thanks !!!

Sandro.
